# F.A.Q

::list{type="warning"}
- We DO NOT encourage piracy and made for purely educational purposes / personal use / just for listen not for downloading.
- I'm currently paying for a Tidal HiFi Plus subscription.
- We Dont have any GUI Application for android / ios / windows / mac / linux contributors are welcome.
- You can access our rest api for free if you want to self-host then need tidal subscription.
- TUI is plug & play also you can add your own tidal account but by default it has our API so you can listen tidal music for free.
- TL;DR HIFI API Can Get Any Quality & Codec Which Tidal Offer / Some Qualities & Codecs Need Special Driver / Song / Hardware to get maximum output i always recommend to use HI_RES or LOSSLESS both are in flac.
- Currently We don't have any GUI Application for android / ios / windows / mac / linux contributors are welcome.
